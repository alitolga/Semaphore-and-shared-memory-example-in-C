# OS Homework - Semaphore and shared memory example in C

This is my Operating Systems homework which I did in my 2nd year in ITU CE. It provides an example for the usage of semaphores and shared memory in C. Details can be found in the pdf file and the explanation is in readme.txt. 

Basically the program takes an integer value and puts it to shared memory. Different processes use/change that shared variable so we must use semaphores to ensure there aren't any read/write problems.
